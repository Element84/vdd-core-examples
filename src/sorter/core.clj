; This is a little convoluted. The qsort algorithm in clojure is recursive so it only looks at a portion of the list
; at a time. I wanted the entire list to be displayed in the visualization so this keeps track of the results
; and appends or prepends the portions of the list that were missing in the recursed captured data.
; TODO We should simplify this and we can handle it in the visualization.
; We want to show only the active data at any particular time. We should be able to send the the pieces
; of the component data to visualize without having to squash everything together
